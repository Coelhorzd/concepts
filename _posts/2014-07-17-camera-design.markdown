## Overview

<br>

### The challenge

Photographic cameras have always had a very similar design, even after they became digital (DSLR and more recently mirrorless) they still have similar looks and controls. An improvement on usability and ergonomics could lead to a lot better experience.   

As an amateur photographer I’ve felt how difficult is to learn how to use a camera properly because it has a lot of buttons and features.   
Most recent Fujifilm's cameras have an interesting experience but could it get even better?
<br>

### My role

This redesign concept took me about 4 months.


<br>

## Discovering
<br>
### User research

I created a survey based on some notes of talks I had with photographers and also from notes I took from a video about cameras design and usability.

<br>

The main points taken from the video which contributed to the survey were:

 1 - Quicker and more intuitive way to change Aperture, ISO and shutter speed;   

 2 - Modes A, S, M aren’t most adequate;    

 3 - Dedicated White balance and Tint control with fast access;   

 4 - Shoot modes (single shot, burst), maybe a pressure sensor to change FPS while shooting;   

 5 - More efficient way to move the focus point on screen;    

 6 - More efficient way to zoom in and out and move around when reviewing a photo;    

 7 - Being able to save settings for photo or video and alternate between them quickly;   

 8 - When using a mirrorless camera's viewfinder, be able to choose whether a scene is shown regard or regardless
    exposure;    

 9 - All (or most) buttons and adjustments on the right hand;    

10 - Screen - better quality, bigger and more responsible touch screen;   

11 - Battery door on the side and not on the bottom;   

12 - Better strap conection and easy lock/unlock system to easy changes;    

13 - Proper eyepiece locking system, to prevent losing it;   

14 - Improving camera ergonomics (weight, size, shape);    


<br>
Notes from chats with photographers and my observations also contributed to the survey.

<br>
**7 photographers answered it.**

## Defining    

### What I've found:   
Lots of answers became an affinity mapping
